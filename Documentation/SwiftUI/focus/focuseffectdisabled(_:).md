# focusEffectDisabled(_:)

Adds a condition that controls whether this view can display focus effects, such as a default focus ring or hover effect.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func focusEffectDisabled(_ disabled: Bool = true) -> some View

```

### Return Value

A view that controls whether focus effects can be displayed in this view.

### Discussion

The higher views in a view hierarchy can override the value you set on this view. In the following example, the button does not display a focus effect because the outer `focusEffectDisabled(_:)` modifier overrides the inner one:

```swift
HStack {
    Button("Press") {}
        .focusEffectDisabled(false)
}
.focusEffectDisabled(true)
```

## Parameters

- **disabled**: A Boolean value that determines whether this view can display focus effects.
