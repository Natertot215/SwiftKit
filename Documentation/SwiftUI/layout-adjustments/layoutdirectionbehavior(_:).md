# layoutDirectionBehavior(_:)

Sets the behavior of this view for different layout directions.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func layoutDirectionBehavior(_ behavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior) -> some View

```

### Return Value

A view that conditionally mirrors its contents horizontally in a given layout direction.

### Discussion

Use `layoutDirectionBehavior(_:)` when you need the system to horizontally mirror the contents of the view when presented in a layout direction.

To override the layout direction for a specific view, use the `View/environment(_:_:)` view modifier to explicitly override the `EnvironmentValues/layoutDirection` environment value for the view.

## Parameters

- **behavior**: A LayoutDirectionBehavior value that indicates whether this view should mirror in a particular layout direction. By default, views will adjust their layouts automatically in a right-to-left context and do not need to be mirrored.
