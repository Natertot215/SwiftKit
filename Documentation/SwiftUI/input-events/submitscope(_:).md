# submitScope(_:)

Prevents submission triggers originating from this view to invoke a submission action configured by a submission modifier higher up in the view hierarchy.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func submitScope(_ isBlocking: Bool = true) -> some View

```

### Discussion

Use this modifier when you want to avoid specific views from initiating a submission action configured by the `View/onSubmit(of:_:)` modifier. In the example below, the tag field doesn’t trigger the submission of the form:

```swift
Form {
    TextField("Username", text: $viewModel.userName)
    SecureField("Password", text: $viewModel.password)

    TextField("Tags", text: $viewModel.tags)
        .submitScope()
}
.onSubmit {
    guard viewModel.validate() else { return }
    viewModel.login()
}
```

## Parameters

- **isBlocking**: A Boolean that indicates whether this scope is actively blocking submission triggers from reaching higher submission actions.
