# Slider

## Declaration

```swift
struct Slider<Label, ValueLabel> where Label : View, ValueLabel : View
```

## Abstract

A control for selecting a value from a bounded linear range of values.

## Overview

A slider consists of a "thumb" image that the user moves between two extremes of a linear "track". The ends of the track represent the minimum and maximum possible values. As the user moves the thumb, the slider updates its bound value.

The following example shows a slider bound to the value `speed`. As the slider updates this value, a bound `Text` view shows the value updating. The `onEditingChanged` closure passed to the slider receives callbacks when the user drags the slider. The example uses this to change the color of the value text.

```swift
@State private var speed = 50.0
@State private var isEditing = false

var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Slider(
            value: $speed,
            in: 0...100,
            onEditingChanged: { editing in
                isEditing = editing
            }
        )
        Text("\(speed)")
            .foregroundColor(isEditing ? .red : .blue)
    }
}
```

You can also use a `step` parameter to provide incremental steps along the path of the slider. For example, if you have a slider with a range of `0` to `100`, and you set the `step` value to `5`, the slider's increments would be `0`, `5`, `10`, and so on. The following example shows this approach, and also adds optional minimum and maximum value labels:

```swift
@State private var speed = 50.0
@State private var isEditing = false

var body: some View {
    Slider(
        value: $speed,
        in: 0...100,
        step: 5
    ) {
        Text("Speed")
    } minimumValueLabel: {
        Text("0")
    } maximumValueLabel: {
        Text("100")
    } onEditingChanged: { editing in
        isEditing = editing
    }
    Text("\(speed)")
        .foregroundColor(isEditing ? .red : .blue)
}
```

The slider also uses the `step` to increase or decrease the value when a VoiceOver user adjusts the slider with voice commands.
