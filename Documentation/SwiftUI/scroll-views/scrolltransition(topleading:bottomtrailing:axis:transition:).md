# scrollTransition(topLeading:bottomTrailing:axis:transition:)

Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func scrollTransition(topLeading: ScrollTransitionConfiguration, bottomTrailing: ScrollTransitionConfiguration, axis: Axis? = nil, transition: @escaping @Sendable (EmptyVisualEffect, ScrollTransitionPhase) -> some VisualEffect) -> some View

```



## Parameters

- **topLeading**: The configuration that drives the transition when the view is about to appear at the top edge of a vertical scroll view, or the leading edge of a horizont scroll view.
- **bottomTrailing**: The configuration that drives the transition when the view is about to appear at the bottom edge of a vertical scroll view, or the trailing edge of a horizont scroll view.
- **axis**: The axis of the containing scroll view over which the transition will be applied. The default value of `nil` uses the axis of the innermost containing scroll view, or `.vertical` if the innermost scroll view is scrollable along both axes.
