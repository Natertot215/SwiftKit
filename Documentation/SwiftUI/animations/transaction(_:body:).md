# transaction(_:body:)

Applies the given transaction mutation function to all animations used within the `body` closure.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func transaction<V>(_ transform: @escaping (inout Transaction) -> Void, @ViewBuilder body: (PlaceholderContentView<Self>) -> V) -> some View where V : View

```

### Discussion

Any modifiers applied to the content of `body` will be applied to this view, and the changes to the transaction performed in the `transform` will only affect the modifiers defined in the `body`.

The following code animates the opacity changing with a faster animation, while the contents of MyView are animated with the implicit transaction:

```swift
MyView(isActive: isActive)
    .transaction { transaction in
        transaction.animation = transaction.animation?.speed(2)
    } body: { content in
        content.opacity(isActive ? 1.0 : 0.0)
    }
```
