# renameAction(_:)

Sets a closure to run for the rename action.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func renameAction(_ action: @escaping () -> Void) -> some View

```

### Return Value

A view that has the specified rename action.

### Discussion

Use this modifier in conjunction with the `RenameButton` to implement standard rename interactions. A rename button receives its action from the environment. Use this modifier to customize the action provided to the rename button.

```swift
struct RowView: View {
    @State private var text = ""
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    var body: some View {
        TextField(text: $item.name) {
            Text("Prompt")
        }
        .focused($isFocused)
        .contextMenu {
            RenameButton()
            // ... your own custom actions
        }
        .renameAction { isFocused = true }
}
```

When the user taps the rename button in the context menu, the rename action focuses the text field by setting the `isFocused` property to true.

## Parameters

- **action**: A closure to run when renaming.
