# scrollDismissesKeyboard(_:)

Configures the behavior in which scrollable content interacts with the software keyboard.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func scrollDismissesKeyboard(_ mode: ScrollDismissesKeyboardMode) -> some View

```

### Return Value

A view that uses the specified keyboard dismissal mode.

### Discussion

You use this modifier to customize how scrollable content interacts with the software keyboard. For example, you can specify a value of `ScrollDismissesKeyboardMode/immediately` to indicate that you would like scrollable content to immediately dismiss the keyboard if present when a scroll drag gesture begins.

```swift
@State private var text = ""

ScrollView {
    TextField("Prompt", text: $text)
    ForEach(0 ..< 50) { index in
        Text("\(index)")
            .padding()
    }
}
.scrollDismissesKeyboard(.immediately)
```

You can also use this modifier to customize the keyboard dismissal behavior for other kinds of scrollable views, like a `List` or a `TextEditor`.

By default, a `TextEditor` is interactive while other kinds of scrollable content always dismiss the keyboard on a scroll when linked against iOS 16 or later. Pass a value of `ScrollDismissesKeyboardMode/never` to indicate that scrollable content should never automatically dismiss the keyboard.

## Parameters

- **mode**: The keyboard dismissal mode that scrollable content uses.
