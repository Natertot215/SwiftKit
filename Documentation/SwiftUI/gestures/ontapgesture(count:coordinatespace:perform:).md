# onTapGesture(count:coordinateSpace:perform:)

Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a tap gesture, and provides the action with the location of the interaction.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func onTapGesture(count: Int = 1, coordinateSpace: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol = .local, perform action: @escaping (CGPoint) -> Void) -> some View

```

### Discussion

Use this method to perform the specified `action` when the user clicks or taps on the modified view `count` times. The action closure receives the location of the interaction.

> **NOTE:** If you create a control that’s functionally equivalent to a `Button`, use `ButtonStyle` to create a customized button instead.

The following code adds a tap gesture to a `Circle` that toggles the color of the circle based on the tap location.

```swift
struct TapGestureExample: View {
    @State private var location: CGPoint = .zero

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(self.location.y > 50 ? Color.blue : Color.red)
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100, alignment: .center)
            .onTapGesture { location in
                self.location = location
            }
    }
}
```

## Parameters

- **count**: The number of taps or clicks required to trigger the action closure provided in `action`. Defaults to `1`.
- **coordinateSpace**: The coordinate space in which to receive location values. Defaults to `CoordinateSpace/local`.
- **action**: The action to perform. This closure receives an input that indicates where the interaction occurred.
