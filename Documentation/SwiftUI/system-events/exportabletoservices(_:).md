# exportableToServices(_:)

Exports items for consumption by shortcuts, quick actions, and services.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func exportableToServices<T>(_ payload: @autoclosure @escaping () -> [T]) -> some View where T : Transferable

```

### Discussion

If the associated view supports selection, the exported item should reflect that selected subpart.

```swift
var title: String
var body: some View {
    Color.pink
        .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
        .exportableToServices([title])
}
```

## Parameters

- **payload**: A closure that will be called on request of the items by the shortcut or service.





## Availability

- macOS 13.0
