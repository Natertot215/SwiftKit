# accessibilityShowBorders

Whether the system preference for Show Borders is enabled. On macOS this is true when Increased Contrast is enabled.

## Declaration

```swift
@backDeployed(before: iOS 26.1, macOS 26.1, tvOS 26.1, watchOS 26.1, visionOS 26.1)
var accessibilityShowBorders: Bool { get }
```

### Discussion

If this property’s value is true, interactive custom controls such as buttons should be drawn in such a way that their edges and borders are clearly visible.
