# environment(_:_:)

Sets the environment value of the specified key path to the given value.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func environment<V>(_ keyPath: WritableKeyPath<EnvironmentValues, V>, _ value: V) -> some Scene

```

### Return Value

A view that has the given value set in its environment.

### Discussion

Use this modifier to set one of the writable properties of the `EnvironmentValues` structure, including custom values that you create. For example, you can create a custom environment key `styleOverrides` to set a value that represents style settings that for the entire app:

```swift
WindowGroup {
    ContentView()
}
.environment(\.styleOverrides, StyleOverrides())
```

You then read the value inside `ContentView` or one of its descendants using the `Environment` property wrapper:

```swift
struct MyView: View {
    @Environment(\.styleOverrides) var styleOverrides: StyleOverrides

    var body: some View { ... }
}
```

This modifier affects the given scene, as well as that scene’s descendant views. It has no effect outside the view hierarchy on which you call it.

## Parameters

- **keyPath**: A key path that indicates the property of the `EnvironmentValues` structure to update.
- **value**: The new value to set for the item specified by `keyPath`.
