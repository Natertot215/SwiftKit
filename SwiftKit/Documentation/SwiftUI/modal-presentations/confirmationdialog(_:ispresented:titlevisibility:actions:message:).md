# confirmationDialog(_:isPresented:titleVisibility:actions:message:)

Presents a confirmation dialog with a message when a given condition is true, using a text view for the title.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func confirmationDialog<A, M>(_ title: Text, isPresented: Binding<Bool>, titleVisibility: Visibility = .automatic, @ViewBuilder actions: () -> A, @ViewBuilder message: () -> M) -> some View where A : View, M : View

```

### Discussion

In the example below, a button conditionally presents a confirmation dialog depending upon the value of a bound Boolean variable. When the Boolean value is set to `true`, the system displays a confirmation dialog with a cancel action and a destructive action.

```swift
struct ConfirmEraseItems: View {
    @State private var isShowingDialog = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("Empty Trash") {
            isShowingDialog = true
        }
        .confirmationDialog(
            Text("Permanently erase the items in the trash?"),
            isPresented: $isShowingDialog
        ) {
            Button("Empty Trash", role: .destructive) {
                // Handle empty trash action.
            }
        } message: {
            Text("You cannot undo this action.")
        }
    }
}
```

All actions in a confirmation dialog will dismiss the dialog after the action runs. The default button will be shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the `KeyboardShortcut/defaultAction` keyboard shortcut.

The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.

Dialogs include a standard dismiss action by default. If you provide a button with a role of `ButtonRole/cancel`, that button takes the place of the default dismiss action. You don’t have to dismiss the presentation with the cancel button’s action.

> **NOTE:** In regular size classes in iOS, the system renders confirmation dialogs as a popover that the user dismisses by tapping anywhere outside the popover, rather than displaying the standard dismiss action.

## Parameters

- **title**: The title of the dialog.
- **isPresented**: A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the dialog. When the user presses or taps the dialog’s default action button, the system sets this value to `false`, dismissing the dialog.
- **titleVisibility**: The visibility of the dialog’s title. The default value is `Visibility/automatic`.
- **actions**: A view builder returning the dialog’s actions.
- **message**: A view builder returning the message for the dialog.
