# accessibilityDropPoint(_:description:isEnabled:)

The point an assistive technology should use to end a drag interaction.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func accessibilityDropPoint(_ point: UnitPoint, description: LocalizedStringKey, isEnabled: Bool) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
```

### Discussion

Use this modifier when you need to provide a description to users when prompted end a drag interaction.

```swift
struct FolderView: View {
    var folderName: String

    var body: some View {
        FolderIcon(folderName: folderName)
            .accessibilityDropPoint(
                .center, description: Text("Move to \(folderName)"))
    }
}
```

By default, if an accessible view or its subtree has drag and/or drop interactions, they will be automatically exposed by assistive technologies. However, if there is more than one such interaction, each drag or drop should have a description to disambiguate it and give a good user experience.

> **NOTE:** An accessibility element can have multiple points for a drop, provided they have different descriptions.

## Parameters

- **point**: The point the assistive technology will perform a drop interaction.
- **description**: The description of the drop interaction.
- **isEnabled**: If true the accessibility drop point is applied; otherwise the accessibility drop point is unchanged.
