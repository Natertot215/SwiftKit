# mask(alignment:_:)

Masks this view using the alpha channel of the given view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func mask<Mask>(alignment: Alignment = .center, @ViewBuilder _ mask: () -> Mask) -> some View where Mask : View

```

### Discussion

Use `mask(_:)` when you want to apply the alpha (opacity) value of another view to the current view.

This example shows an image masked by rectangle with a 10% opacity:

```swift
Image(systemName: "envelope.badge.fill")
    .foregroundColor(Color.blue)
    .font(.system(size: 128, weight: .regular))
    .mask {
        Rectangle().opacity(0.1)
    }
```

## Parameters

- **alignment**: The alignment for `mask` in relation to this view.
- **mask**: The view whose alpha the rendering system applies to the specified view.
