# grayscale(_:)

Adds a grayscale effect to this view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func grayscale(_ amount: Double) -> some View

```

### Return Value

A view that adds a grayscale effect to this view.

### Discussion

A grayscale effect reduces the intensity of colors in this view.

The example below shows a series of red squares with their grayscale effect increasing from 0 (reddest) to 99% (fully desaturated) in approximate 20% increments:

```swift
struct Saturation: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(0..<6) {
                Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60, alignment: .center)
                    .grayscale(Double($0) * 0.1999)
                    .overlay(Text("\(Double($0) * 0.1999 * 100, specifier: "%.4f")%"),
                             alignment: .bottom)
                    .border(Color.gray)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Parameters

- **amount**: The intensity of grayscale to apply from 0.0 to less than 1.0. Values closer to 0.0 are more colorful, and values closer to 1.0 are less colorful.
