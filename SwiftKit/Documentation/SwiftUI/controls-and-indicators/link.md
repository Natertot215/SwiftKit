# Link

A control for navigating to a URL.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor @preconcurrency struct Link<Label> where Label : View
```

### Overview

Create a link by providing a destination URL and a title. The title tells the user the purpose of the link, and can be a string, a title key that produces a localized string, or a view that acts as a label. The example below creates a link to `example.com` and displays the title string as a link-styled view:

```swift
Link("View Our Terms of Service",
      destination: URL(string: "https://www.example.com/TOS.html")!)
```

When a user taps or clicks a `Link`, the default behavior depends on the contents of the URL. For example, SwiftUI opens a Universal Link in the associated app if possible, or in the user’s default web browser if not. Alternatively, you can override the default behavior by setting the `EnvironmentValues/openURL` environment value with a custom `OpenURLAction`:

```swift
Link("Visit Our Site", destination: URL(string: "https://www.example.com")!)
    .environment(\.openURL, OpenURLAction { url in
        print("Open \(url)")
        return .handled
    })
```

As with other views, you can style links using standard view modifiers depending on the view type of the link’s label. For example, a `Text` label could be modified with a custom `View/font(_:)` or `View/foregroundStyle(_:)` to customize the appearance of the link in your app’s UI.
