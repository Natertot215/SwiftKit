# contextMenu(menuItems:)

Adds a context menu to a view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func contextMenu<MenuItems>(@ViewBuilder menuItems: () -> MenuItems) -> some View where MenuItems : View

```

### Return Value

A view that can display a context menu.

### Discussion

Use this modifier to add a context menu to a view in your app’s user interface. Compose the menu by returning controls like `Button`, `Toggle`, and `Picker` from the `menuItems` closure. You can also use `Menu` to define submenus or `Section` to group items.

The following example creates a `Text` view that has a context menu with two buttons:

```swift
Text("Turtle Rock")
    .padding()
    .contextMenu {
        Button {
            // Add this item to a list of favorites.
        } label: {
            Label("Add to Favorites", systemImage: "heart")
        }
        Button {
            // Open Maps and center it on this item.
        } label: {
            Label("Show in Maps", systemImage: "mappin")
        }
    }
```

When someone activates the context menu with an action like touch and hold in iOS or iPadOS, the system displays the menu next to the content:

The system dismisses the menu if someone makes a selection, or taps or clicks outside the menu.

To customize the default preview, apply a `View/contentShape(_:_:eoFill:)` with a `ContentShapeKinds/contextMenuPreview` kind. For example, you can change the preview’s corner radius or use a nested view as the preview.

> **NOTE:** This view modifier produces a context menu on macOS, but that platform doesn’t display a preview.

If you want to show a different preview, you can use `View/contextMenu(menuItems:preview:)`. To add a context menu to a container that supports selection, like a `List` or a `Table`, and to distinguish between menu activation on a selection and activation in an empty area of the container, use `View/contextMenu(forSelectionType:menu:primaryAction:)`.

## Parameters

- **menuItems**: A closure that produces the menu’s contents. You can deactivate the context menu by returning nothing from the closure.
