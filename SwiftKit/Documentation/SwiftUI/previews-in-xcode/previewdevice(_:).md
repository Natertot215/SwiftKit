# previewDevice(_:)

Overrides the device for a preview.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func previewDevice(_ value: PreviewDevice?) -> some View

```

### Return Value

A preview that uses the given device.

### Discussion

By default, Xcode automatically chooses a preview device based on your currently selected run destination. If you want to choose a device that doesn’t change based on Xcode settings, provide a `PreviewDevice` instance that you initialize with the name or model of a specific device:

```swift
struct CircleImage_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        CircleImage()
            .previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPad Pro (11-inch)"))
    }
}
```

You can get a list of supported preview device names, like “iPhone 11”, “iPad Pro (11-inch)”, and “Apple Watch Series 5 - 44mm”, by using the `xcrun` command in the Terminal app:

```swift
% xcrun simctl list devicetypes
```

Additionally, you can use the following values for macOS platform development:

- “Mac”
- “Mac Catalyst”

## Parameters

- **value**: A device to use for preview, or `nil` to let Xcode automatically choose a device based on the run destination.
