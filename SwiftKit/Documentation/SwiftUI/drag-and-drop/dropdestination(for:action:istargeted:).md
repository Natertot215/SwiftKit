# dropDestination(for:action:isTargeted:)

Defines the destination of a drag and drop operation that handles the dropped content with a closure that you specify.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func dropDestination<T>(for payloadType: T.Type = T.self, action: @escaping ([T], CGPoint) -> Bool, isTargeted: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }) -> some View where T : Transferable

```

### Return Value

A view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified type.

### Discussion

The dropped content can be provided as binary data, file URLs, or file promises.

The drop destination is the same size and position as this view.

```swift
@State private var isDropTargeted = false

var body: some View {
    Color.pink
        .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
        .dropDestination(for: String.self) { receivedTitles, location in
            animateDrop(at: location)
            process(titles: receivedTitles)
        } isTargeted: {
            isDropTargeted = $0
        }
}

func process(titles: [String]) { ... }
func animateDrop(at: CGPoint) { ... }
```

## Parameters

- **payloadType**: The expected type of the dropped models.
- **action**: A closure that takes the dropped content and responds appropriately. The first parameter to `action` contains the dropped items. The second parameter contains the drop location in this view’s coordinate space. Return `true` if the drop operation was successful; otherwise, return `false`.
- **isTargeted**: A closure that is called when a drag and drop operation enters or exits the drop target area. The received value is `true` when the cursor is inside the area, and `false` when the cursor is outside.
